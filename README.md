# Pizza Restaurant MySQL Database

Project where I designed a MySQL database for a pizza restaurant...

Objectives included:

1. Creating the database schema that allowed them to track:
   -[] incoming customer orders
   -[] customers name and phone number
   -[] date/time of the order

2. Testing funcitonality by populating database with 4 orders

3. Writing SQL queries to allow restaurant to know:
   -[] which customers are spending the most money
   -[] total spend of each individual customer
   -[] how much each customer orders on each day
